# Cbthelper


cbthelper (PHP) wraps CrossBrowserTesting's selenium api into an easy to use library. CrossBrowserTesting provides a device lab in the cloud so you don't have to manage your own device lab with multiple browser versions. Run your selenium tests across multiple device and browser combinations at a time and quickly jump to a live test to debug. With this wrapper, you can easily start a Selenium test, take a snapshot, set test score, and much more.

## Installation

Using Composer

```php
composer require crossbrowsertesting/cbthelper:dev-master
```


## Usage

See example.php. Don't forget to set your username and authkey, which can be found under Accounts and Settings, in that file. Don't have a CrossBrowserTesting account? Start a free trial at https://crossbrowsertesting.com/ and start running your Selenium tests in the cloud.
